# SkinCancerPrediction

Based on [publickly available](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylegraupe/skin-cancer-binary-classification-dataset), already categorised data, such as **Cancer** or **Non_Cancer**, I tested 4 different pre-train models, in order to be able to predict category of unseed pictures (isolated from the original dataset)


# Dataset
The [Skin Cancer Binary Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kylegraupe/skin-cancer-binary-classification-dataset) contains several pictures with different sizes.
